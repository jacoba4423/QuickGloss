# QuickGloss
Welcome to QuickGloss! This is a tool for documentary linguists to be able to preserve under-resourced languages more efficiently. You can find the frontend of our code in the "templates" and "static" folders.

QuickGloss aims to the process of glossing, and, more broadly, linguistic preservation. We have three main features: speech to text, manual glossing, and, our centerpiece, automated glossing. Our speech to text takes an audio file of native speaker materials, and automatically transcribes it. It then prompts the user to gloss that transcribed text. The user then uploads a necessary corpus of morphemes, including as many or as little properties as they would like, in a custom list format. Our program automatically detects which language is being used; if we do not support that language, the user is prompted to the "manual glossing" section. The algorithm then matches the morphemes with the ones in the provided sentences, and marks it down using standard Leipzig notation. Finally, for the morphemes not found in the corpus, it uses predictive ML techniques to extrapolate likely glosses based on morphological patterns in the language.
